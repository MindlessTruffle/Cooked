    <h3>What even is this?</h3>
    <p>Am I Cooked is an app that aims to help you understand and overcome your worries. Looking back to see all the things you've moved on from can be a way for you to look forward with no regrets!</p>
    <h3>How do I use it?</h3>
    <p>You can go to the main page and input whatever you are worried about. After what you were worrying about had passed, you can classify how it went, seeing how everything else went too. You can also generate a poem and see how much you have gone through in your journey.</p>
    <h3>Why was it made?</h3>
    <p>As silly as it seems, being “cooked” is a feeling that a lot of people in our generation are feeling. All of the new or climatic experiences, exams, competitions, interviews, or anything else that feels important occupies your brainspace to the point where it is difficult to remember all of the past challenges that you KNOW that you’ve overcome. I saw creating this app as an opportunity to relate others the message of how <strong>worries just come and go.</strong>
